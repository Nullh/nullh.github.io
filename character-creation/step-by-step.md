## Step 1 - Pick Your Priorities

Match each column (Metatype, Attributes, Skills, Magic, Resources) to a priority (A through E). A is most important, E is least. The full table is on p64.

For each priority you get the value of the column you selected for that priority. 

For example picking Resources for Priority C gives you 150,000 nuyen.

|**PRIORITY**|**METATYPE**|**ATTRIBUTES**|**SKILLS**|**MAGIC OR RESONANCE**|**RESOURCES**|
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|A|Dwarf, Ork, Troll (13)|24|32|Full: 4 Magic, Aspected: 5 Magic, Mystic Adept:4 Magic, Adept: 4 Magic, Technomancer: 4 Resonance|450,000|
|B|Dwarf, Elf, Ork, Troll (11)|16|24|Full: 3 Magic, Aspected: 4 Magic, Mystic Adept: 3 Magic, Adept: 3 Magic, Technomancer: 3 Resonance|275,000|
|C|Dwarf, Elf, Human, Ork, Troll (9)|12|20|Full: 2 Magic, Aspected: 3 Magic, Mystic Adept: 2 Magic, Adept: 2 Magic, Technomancer: 2 Resonance|150,000|
|D|Dwarf, Elf, Human, Ork, Troll (4)|8|16|Full: 1 Magic, Aspected: 2 Magic, Mystic Adept: 1 Magic, Adept: 1 Magic, Technomancer: 1 Resonance|50,000|
|E|Dwarf, Elf, Human, Ork, Troll (1)|2|10|Mundane|8,000|

## Step 2 - Pick Metatype

Pick a metatype then spend the adjustment points (in the brackets to the right of the metatypes in the chart) on a 1 for 1 upgrade of Edge, Magic or Resonance, or to increase a stat above 6, within the allowable range for your metatype.

|**Metatype**|**Body**|**Agility**|**Reaction**|**Strength**|**Willpower**|**Logic**|**Intuition**|**Charisma**|**Edge**|**Racial Qualities**|
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|Human|1-6|1-6|1-6|1-6|1-6|1-6|1-6|1-6|1-7|None|
|Dwarf|1-7|1-6|1-5|1-8|1-7|1-6|1-6|1-6|1-6|Toxin Resistance, Thermographic Vision|
|Elf|1-6|1-7|1-6|1-6|1-6|1-6|1-6|1-8|1-6|Low-light Vision|
|Ork|1-8|1-6|1-6|1-8|1-6|1-6|1-6|1-5|1-6|Low-light Vision, Built Tough 1|
|Troll|1-9|1-5|1-6|1-9|1-6|1-6|1-6|1-5|1-6|Dermal Deposits, Thermographic Vision, Built Tough 2|

## Step 3 - Select Attributes

On a 1 for 1 basis spend the attribute points for your attribute priority. 

Attributes must be witin the range for your metatype. 

You can use adjustment points from Step 2 to to increase attributes above 6 if your metatype allows it.

## Step 4 - Assign Skills

On a one for one basis, spend your priority's worth of points on skills. You can only increase a skill to rank 6 to begin with (unless you take the Aptitude quality later). You can also pick a single cpecialization within a skill for one point. Skills are on p92:

## Step 5 - Pick Magic/Resonance

Pick what type of magic user you want to be and write down the magic (or resonance) stat for that type. You can increase the magic (or resonance) stats with adjustment points from Step 2.

## Step 6 - Resources

Note down how many resources you have to buy stuff. You can convert left over karma to resources later.

## Step 7 - Select Qualities

p70 defines these. There are lots! Positive ones cost karma, negative ones give karma.

## Step 8 - Spend Karma

You have 50 karma to level up your character. Don't forget to add/deduct karma for the qualities you picked in Step 7.

**TYPE**|**KARMA COST**
:-----:|:-----:
Active skills|5 x new rank
Specializations|5
Expertise|5
Attributes|5 x new rank
Knowledge skills|3
Spell|5 per spell
Complex form|5 per form
Initiation|10 + initiate grade
Submersion|10 + submersion level

## Step 9 - Buy Gear

Spend your nuyen on some gear. Leftover karma is converted to nuyen at 1 karma to 2,000 nuyen (or 5,000 if you pick the In Debt negative quality). Gear is on page 244.

You cannot choose any starting gear thats illegal with a rating of 7 or higher.
