Shadowrun character creation is pretty in-depth with a lot of choices to make. The best way to make a character is going into creation with an idea of the kind of character you are trying to make.

Below are the suggested questions you should try and answer before creating your character:

- Character concept/description
- History
  - Where was your character born?
  - Where was your character raised?
  - Where was your character trained?
  - Where is your character now?
  - How does your character feel about:
    - Wetwork?
    - Drugs and alcohol?
    - Trafficking?
    - Racism and injustice?
