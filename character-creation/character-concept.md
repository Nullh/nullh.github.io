Shadowrun character creation is pretty in-depth with a lot of choices to make. The bets way to make a character is going into creation already having an idea of the kind of character you are trying to make.

Below are the suggested question you should try and answer before creating your character:

- Character concept/description
- History
  - Where was your character born?
  - Where was your charact6er raised?
  - Where was your character trained?
  - Where is your character now?
  - How does your character feel about:
    - Wetork?
    - Drugs and alcohol?
    - Trafficking?
    - Racism and injustice?
